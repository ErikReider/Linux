# Border Image Samples
This folder contains sample border images for anyone's use. A `testing.png` file also provides borders which can be used for easier debugging of incorrect border image rendering.

Feel free to add your own and make a PR, as long as they aren't _too_ similar to existing samples. Please keep them list in alphabetical order. Keep in mind that this directory will likely be removed once the contrib script for creating such images becomes available.
